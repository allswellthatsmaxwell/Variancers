Characters take on different styles of luck management and buildup. An assassin, or just a student studying for a test, sits and rolls dice for small amounts of money until they get a bad string of rolls, then they depart for their task. (One can get a better outcome by betting more of their net worth). Some, who encounter wondrous luck, become despondent, and barricade themselves in their homes, avoid crossing the street or touching wires… 

How to avoid the roll-dice-at-home strategy being what everyone does? Do methods expire, or weaken? Or perhaps a single up-boon / down-boon per type of activity? Or each activity refreshes after a couple of weeks - this is good narrative-action-wise, since one would then expend power during combat by running through their various boon-generation methods, and need it NOW but it doesn’t refresh for two weeks. Or boon transmutation costs - see further down.

How does insurance change? By insuring oneself, one loses the future blessing granted by a car accident.

When amazing things happen to people on normal days, they run and take shelter. 

Oh, also, do boons and downboons decay? Can one wait it out?

The probability of the bad thing matters. Guns can jam or explode (is this true? no), or bullets can be faulty, or bounce off surfaces, but melee weapons don’t have such issues, so they are far more common, and everyone’s preferred armament. (Though extreme risk takers may still carry them). Even carrying a gun could be dangerous - the safety mechanism isn’t dependable, after all.

Our protagonist, of course, will have to be ignorant of these things. How to make it so?

Some people prefer a more conservative style, aiming to minimize their downboons. Others aim to deploy large upboons at the right time, so take on the corresponding risk.

Manufacturing upboons quickly is the alchemy of this world - everyone is interested in it, if it existed it would be totally broken busted, but fundamental theory says it can’t be done.

How much do the boonsprites know? Can you trick them by losing a major monetary bet to your wife, who then just puts it back into the joint account? Probably not. But more advanced misdirection? May be possible. What if someone cheats on a gamble, but you don’t know they cheated? Does that grant upboons, or is it neutral? If the former, sending a swindler to a friend before an important day could be a nice gift.

Does this stuff affect everyone, or only those who have undergone some kind of ritual (like Pact/Pale’s Awakening ritual)? I like it being only a select group, I think. Or - perhaps these boon forces only affect normal people a little, and the awakening ritual spikes the variance. They could be called variancers. Well, or just gamblers, but something like variancer is cool! The awakening is called being Envarianced.

When a natural disaster, or other shared misfortune happens, everyone is upbooned. There is major alpha in knowing what is actually bad - those who think candidate X being elected grants them an upboon may find the boonsprites didn’t agree. This goes for more mundane matters too - one forgets their keys - bad luck? - but is thus saved from a car accident - so they have a major downboon when they think they are under a minor upboon. This is so important that some variancers, and even non-variancers, specialize in it, and serve as advisors to more direct players.

Actually having a feel for probabilities is also very important. Calculating them on the fly is useful constantly, and for important matters, sitting down and estimating and running simulations is considered prudent. It’s bad to think you have a 1/10 downboon when it’s actually 1/100. But once you’re downbooned badly enough, these calculations themselves will fail… and the most severe downboons can cause blood clots and other medical emergencies.

The story doesn’t start with combat. It starts more mundane than this. 

~~Because the mechanism is so important to the amount of variance a boon can add, roulette is still a rigidly invariant game for all but the largest-booned variancers, but blackjack and poker are different.~~

Transmutation of boons from one domain to another comes with a cost. The most boonswing happens when doing the same thing as granted the boon; the more dissimilar the activity, the less the boon transfers. So one actually cannot roll dice in order to successfully assassinate someone with a rifle, but perhaps if dice were worked into the method somehow…

Perhaps one can extend upboon time, delaying the adjustment back to neutral, at the cost of suffering worse downboons later.

Perhaps every human is born with a protection spell, to protect them from downboons by drastically limiting their variance. (This is called The Dampen. “He’s damped” is another way of saying “he’s not a variancer.” A character mutters “Dampened” to another to indicate a room full of people is mundane.) Variancers are those who have surrendered this protection. Then it can take place in our world.

Some rare variancers can feel the boons on themselves, but most have no sensation of it. Others can do a Reading to learn the boons another person currently has on them, but this takes time.

Knowing base rates is critical. How many otherwise-healthy people drop dead from surprise underlying medical conditions per day? How many die or are maimed in accidents? If your downboon is around that probability, you’re in danger! For this reason, variancers hang around in hospital lobbies after smooth, successful missions.

Transferring a million dollars into someone’s bank account means they may die before they even know about the money. This is one of the ways variancers attack their enemies: granting them incredible blessings. Variancers are serious about not having their payment systems known, and it’s considered good practice to deal only in cash. They are extremely wary of accepting items, lest a generous gift be handed to them by a “stranger” and downboon them. The balance of their luck is something variancers strive to know and control. 

An interlude about a man assassinated by a large donation - he notices his clothes fraying while walking, trips, his hand is run over by a car, then a misunderstanding with the driver causes a confrontation, the driver pulls a gun, the man begs and explains, the driver apologizes, goes to holster his weapon but drops it, it goes off… the man discovers the donation on his phone as he pulls it out to call his wife.

Variancers with downboons, panicking, curse Fairness. Those with upboons pray to her. “It’s only Fair.” might be said by one seeing their opponent fall to a downboon. “It isn’t fair” is something no variancer says, except perhaps as a joke.

The Wish. A Wish may be granted to one with a very large upboon. A Wish is ritualized and takes a long time. But too-low boon values - even if they’re up - result in monkey-paw dynamics. 

An interlude about such a Wish.

A madman may aim to cause calamity, to grant a boon to the region the calamity occurs in.

A planned mission may have to be cancelled because someone on the team’s luck was too good on the morning before go time.

Variancers rarely work alone - they can’t control their luck well enough by themselves. Having a partner who generates bad-but-safe luck at the right moments is important. Larger configurations are available, but the fundamental variancer pair is a frontline person and a bad-luck-generator backliner. One need not be a variancer to generate bad luck. This can be our opening scene! A man in dire straits, who has lost his partner, enlists our protagonist as his bad luck generator. 

“With a little bad luck, I’ll be able to do it.”

Systems to generate bad luck require deceiving the boonsprites. The generator saying “pick a number, 1 or 2”, and whispering “don’t pick 1”, doesn’t generate bad luck on a wrong guess. But working out an explicit ruleset beforehand also doesn’t work. Therefore, subtle signals must be made, and partners who work together for a long time are better at this. 

huh. A series of odd/even wrong guesses generates luck a bit slowly. But adding options decreases the base rate of guessing right, so of “choose one”, odd/even is fastest. What system is faster? Actually hurting your partner, physically or abstractly, feels like the main tactic - but how to avoid the boonsprites from catching on? Act like enemies..? A partner is also in a difficult position if the frontliner is wounded or needs direct help, if this works, since if hurting them generates bad luck, helping them would generate good. But getting helped or hurt by someone you know just isn’t something we’d normally call luck, so I’m not too sure about this partner line of thought… I’d very very much like to make it work if possible (but if it isn’t it isn’t).

Yeah, I think intentionally hurting them is out - enemy or allied action is not luck - but there may be other ways for a partner to generate bad luck for their frontline.

Perhaps larger groups are better - in games of chance, one of them likely comes out the worse, and they can switch in. So a team of four or five, where they’re shouting out guessing games, and tracking their own record, and the person who does worse swaps out and becomes the new frontliner temporarily - very very interesting. (Calculating the actual expected negluck generated in K rounds would be a cool inclusion. So this is another thing variancers do - compute the expected speed of negluck generated by various strategies). [I give a crooked smile. “Are you negging me right now?”] And the luck-generators would be targets in combat too - chase down the one on a lucky streak to take them out of the fight while they’re weak.

Transferer. A specialized variancer who can transfer their own luck. It hurts them to do so, so they’re not suited for swapping into being the frontliner.

Perhaps there aren’t boonsprites at all. Perhaps it’s physical law. The law of averages… 

The dampening can temporarily weaken sometimes. This causes chaos.

Perhaps Cassie fails a test after studying hard, because the questions on the test weren’t the ones she studied. And her boyfriend cheats on her due to some unusual circumstance. And people keep telling her “bad luck happens sometimes”, “you can’t control luck”. (It could later be revealed that her streak of bad luck was put on her..? maybe). 

She is in stats 102. College. She’s 19. Blonde, looks kinda like lelliana, with the glasses. Likes stats and probability theory but feels listless and lacks excitement for the future. Doesn’t feel that this thing she likes actually gives her much control. Talks to a statistician that talks about just doing signifigance tests all day and thinks it sounds boring. Is this really her future? Is this all she can use probability theory for?

The initial conflict is with small-time crime variancers - ones doing insurance fraud, perhaps, with variance? She is inducted into a small local policing/FBI type force of four or five people. The man who introduces her to the variance is part of this group.

Title is Variance. 

May have a part in class where the professor teaches the gambler’s fallacy. She frowns, because the gambler’s rule feels at least a little true to her. (It turns out she’s slightly less dampened than most people, which is what causes Abelard to look to her for help initially).

She ends up specializing in backline support (in the taxonomy of front, back, rear).

Maybe ger mother died in an unfortunate accident? And we can give her two friends, a guy and a girl, and her differences from them can help define her. One is a Toby (or magdalena) stand-in - a girl - on exactly the right track, knows exactly what she wants to do, and the other, the guy, who is so much more lost than she is that he doesn’t even mind it and enjoys life as it is. She can’t be happy-go-lucky like he is, but nor can she find the purpose the girl has. So her problem is ennui, but a specific ennui - that of knowing the kind of thing you want to do, but lacking a satisfying expression of it that pays the bills. The disastrous career fair is the catalyst to her looking up abelard after their short adventure together. She can talk to a cop at the career fair that says to her what the real one said to me - you gotta be a beat cop first, and face all the real danger and prove your mettle, then maybe they’ll consider you for the stats desk! And the FBI, or a military guy describing drone strikes. And a corporate guy who talks as if making the company more money is the end goal. Write what you know. Our struggles are hers; write what you know.

We could start the story at school but why? Instead, write as she has just left for the day, it’s early in the quarter, and she’s wandering the streets thinking about her problems. Then abelard shows up. Straight into the action. Then the slower friends and school stuff afterward.

Note that variancers alone and unprepped have little to distinguish them from the dampened in the initial minute of an encounter.

Calculators are backline support that can quickly estimate the current luck of allies and enemies, and shout it out to give communication. Although professional teams communicate it through a headset, so that the enemy doesn’t hear. 

Calculators being able to see through a calculation, instead of having to chain bayes’ rule or whatever, is an important skill. Knowing the distributions, conjugates, and being able to immediately get a decent approximation. When both sides have Calculators, the one who can get their guy the information sooner has an advantage.

Perhaps two people can be linked temporarily, via ritual or device, so that one can transfer their luck to the other. These devices are expensive and rare. Then we can have frontline/midline pairs and it actually makes sense.

Perhaps luck works on different timescales. One who lives destitute and in poverty - “down on his luck” - lives under a soft curtain of boon. As long as he stays in his current living situation, a kind of chill low-grade boon field will help small things go his way. But only long-term things; short-term luck, like the kind that turns in seconds, eg during combat, is another type. The types share a little but suffer a steep conversion fee. So living destitute means you gain more leads, more information, have a lower chance of being discovered, and so on.

Only the likelihood matters for the update. How to combine it with the prior to get the posterior is important too, but the information that flows in from observation only affects the likelihood, and not the prior. So Calculators need to be good at 1) identifying what the likelihood part of the update is and 2) combining it with the prior. The prior, of course, is the subject’s current boon state. Priors are only hard to pick when there is low information. Everyone has a true boonstate, Calculators are trying to estimate it, and their prior is their up-to-now information on what the subject walked into the fight/situation with.

Taking someone’s weapon before they go into combat (in a subtle way that could be passed off as an innocent mistake) helps them in combat. So the fbi group is always kind of messing with abelard as missions get closer. Abelard is also missing a couple fingers on one hand, and low-grade boons smile on him for it.

This makes sense when you think of an expression like “she has all the luck!” No one has all the luck, and when one has reduced combat efficiency due to stuff like lost fingers, compensation is made.

Abelard is grizzled, long divorced, estranged from his children, and operates with a grim determination that recognizes that any permanent injuries or disfigurements he takes will be compensated by with permanent boons. The group is his life, has been for years, and the last chance he sees of making additional impact on the world.

The reason any conflict can be resolved ever is that boons do not apply to groups of any kind, except through specialized temporary pairwise transfer, and other rare and costly Mover abilities. Boons of all kinds only apply to individuals. Therefore, the loss of a teammate does not help any ally, except one that was concurrently paired with them at the time of their incapacitation or demise. If someone was paired, and the victim had the presence of mind to push their luck out one last time, the temporary deathboon is strong indeed. 

Variancers are hard to kill, because being grievously wounded causes an upboon that usually keeps them stable, stops them from going into cardiac arrest, etc, until medical care can be obtained. (It still must be obtained! and going too long without it can spend the boon keeping them alive. And luck can’t regrow a limb or digit. But they are hard to kill).

Abelard was afraid of getting shot by police because he’s a paranoid old kook, not because his downboons were really that bad.

Villian idea: equity-obsessed group intent on canceling the dampening. It isn’t fair, they say, if the gambler’s fallacy isn’t true, because then a luckily timed investment nakes you rich for life. There should be counter compensation.

The meta effects cancel! If you’re bad luck at the right time, that’s lucky, so you get additional bad luck to compensate, but that’s good luck, but that’s bad luck…. All but the first-order meta effects cancel. So this DOES happen but it cancels, so it’s like it didn’t happen.

A normal person just does not have much happen to them. A 1e6 event happens one every 1e6 time intervals… that’s not usually very often. So another thing the Variancer ritual does is increase your base variance… what does that mean tho? A 1e6 event happens 1e3 of the time?

And note that variancers actually built this into the ritual. Because they want variance. Sitting and generating 6 units of bad luck (1 in 1e6) intentionally takes a LONG time and you’ll die before you get many.

Different variancers choose different parameters for their variance increase. Choosing an extremely high parameter means you get rich and famous and then die, or maybe in the other order. Choosing too low makes you not much different from the dampened. And you can increase this parameter later but never decrease it (it wouldn’t be meta-fair; too exploitable).

This makes sense because the ritual removes dampening. You cannot actually choose a parameter than outright kills you in half an hour, because the fully undampened fairness force was never that strong, so you can never reach that strength by removing dampening. But also the dampening ritual is lost and unknown, so you cannot redampen someone - only remove degrees of dampening. And this is not a terribly precise process, but it can at least be aimed a little.

Wait though… you can simulate your coin flips with computers… have your own devices play each other in the coin guessing game, and make computerized payments… much faster generation (in both directions)…

There is a god of fair. There is there is there is. She has opinions but they manifest as flows and barrier ls and gradients; it’s not clear at all that she knows language, or is a she or a single being or intelligent or something like the lifestream or…

Different variancers have different mysticisms around her/it. Some talk of lady luck. Others are in reverence of the god of fairness. Others view it as a resource to be mined; others might see it how aerith sees the lifestream - incorporeal, non-intelligent, but precious and worthy of love and protection.

She doesn’t understand language so you can just openly discuss strategies to optimize your luck balance. There’s not a christian god type entity frowning from above.

Important to discuss (in an interesting way) why two 1e3 events do not compensate for one 1e6 event. If it worked like that, six 1 in 10 events would balance a 1e6 events - but 1 in 10 events happen ALL THE TIME. So it can’t be logarithmic like this. Claude suggests linear; remaining debt after [1e6, 1e3] is 1e6 - 1e3.

All variancers consider the gambler’s truth to be trivially obvious. The long-run expected value of your luck is net zero. Duh. (This is true in our world too). 

Hanging out at a hospital after a mission is a little fishy actually - the chance of catching disease is higher, getting the wrong thing cut, falling off the hospital bed… This group does the hospital thing, but many groups have stopped, having seen too many people catch diseases or die in the operating room or just get an infection from the IV drip or a disease from a blood transfusion. Things go wrong a lot in hospitals!
