The end of the day. Lots to do, but nothing to look forward to. Cass looked up at the sky and ambled through campus. 

When she felt lost like this, she liked to walk in a certain way: she stuck one leg out straight, as high as she could get it without falling (which was pretty low, if she was being honest), then paused before putting that foot down, so she was briefly paused on one foot. Then she put it down flat, all at once, and repeated the process with the other leg. She tried to stay looking at the sky throughout. There were trees all around the college grounds, and she liked how the yellow and orange of the leaves looked when they were at the edges of her vision - the low-grade autumnal background made looking at the sky more interesting. And sometimes the wind blew her hair over her face and she felt like the blonde went with the autumn colors too.

It was the first week of her second year in college and she didn’t know why she felt like this. It wasn’t the classes - she loved statistics, and this year promised to be full of interesting stats. So why? Whatever. She walked.

Her school was near a small city by a big lake. She liked to walk down the big hill - a huge hill, it went for like a mile - down to the lake and back. It was too far for her to do her special stepping process the whole way, so she started walking normally, then started zoning in and out. 

Zone out. She passed a bunch of cool trees on a winding part of the road. 

Zone in. Her glasses blocked the wind that came from the lake and up the hill. Her hair wasn’t that long but it was long enough that the wind would mess it up; but that was okay. The day was done, and she could just go home after. She felt better, being out like this. 

Zone out. A car went by at the normal speed, well within the speed limit. Took one of the winding turns. Went up on two wheels. Tipped onto its side. Rolled over. What? 

Cassie snapped back into focus, and… stood there frozen and staring. There was nobody else around. She heard shattering glass. It unfroze her. She walked fast over to the car. A man was army-crawling out of the driver’s-side window - a hammer lay next to him. He was wearing a heavy black coat, even though it was a warm September day, and his arms and body were protected enough that the small broken shards of glass didn’t seem to hurt him. He looked up at her, then back at the ground in front of him, and finished his exit. He stood up.

The man was old - maybe sixty - with short receded gray hair, and a wide gray beard, also cut short. He looked at her. Cassie had never seen a car crash in real life but in movies and in her imagination, the victim was wide-eyed, shocked, and disoriented. This man was none of these. He looked composed, and the only thing in his eyes was a burning urgency.

“Girl! I need your help.”

“Um. Yes! Of course.” Um. The glass. She rushed to his side and started brushing off the specks of glass on his sleeve.

“Not with that,” he said. She kept fussing over the glass on his sleeves, moving on autopilot.

“Stop for a second!” His voice was commanding now. She stopped. He put a hand on the back of her shoulder, and moved her with him, not rough, but forcefully enough that she had no choice but to walk, bringing them away from the vehicle.

“Um. You’re in shock, I think,” she said. “You, uh, you don’t need to push me. Let’s just catch our breath.” Poor guy. Thousands of cars took this turn, most of them probably going faster than he was.

“I am not in shock. We need to get away from the car.” He gave her one last light push, and when she started moving again, took his hand off her shoulderblade. “Further than this. Keep walking.”

She walked. When they were thirty yards from the crash, he finally stopped. Cassie looked back at the car. She whooshed out a breath of air. “That was… really bad luck.”

He smiled grimly. “Yes. It was.”

She had a second to breathe now, and notice more. The man in front of her was broad-shouldered, and buff, especially for an old guy. Thebf was bleeding a little from a gash, probably from the glass, but yeah, the jacket hadn’t been cut at all. It was a tough material, extremely practical for just the kind of situation he’s found himself in. He had an old scar on his cheek - a long one. And he was missing two fingers on his left hand - the index and pinky. He wasn’t bleeding from his hand, and the skin looked healed over, so obviously not from the crash.

”I can stay, and tell the police you weren’t driving fast or anything. Oh! We need to call 911!” She pulled out her phone.

He plucked her phone out of her hand with surprising deftness. “Hey!” She reached to grab it back, but he turned sideways, blocking her hand. He turned it off and handed it back to her.

“No police. It’s too dangerous. The car will probably catch on fire next.”

She smiled, despite everything, then caught herself and wiped the smile from her face. He was still in shock. “Um, no, it’s okay. Cars don’t really catch on fire after crashes. They do in movies, but that’s just to add some drama, you know? The probability of your car catching on fire just from rolling over is, like, well under 1%.” 

His eyebrows shot up. “Well under 1%, you say? How do you know that?”

She puffed up proudly. She had a mind for numbers, and a good memory. And, well, she might admit to herself, when she was in the right mood, that she could be a little paranoid, and that looking up and reading about such figures was soothing. “I just know! I read about it once. Don’t worry, mister. It’s not going to happen.”

He was looking at her strangely. “That’s a very useful talent.” He looked over his shoulder back at the flipped-over car, and sighed. “But just knowing the base rate isn’t always enough.”

She looked at the car too. Coming from the front… was that… smoke? No way. She put a hand on the frame of her glasses and squinted. It didn’t… cars didn’t just… She had to get a better look. She moved to walk back toward the car, but the man put an arm out in front of her. She frowned, but already there was no need to get closer to confirm. A small flame was coming up from the undercarriage.

“That’s…” she breathed. “How…?”

“Like you said,” The man looked into her eyes. “Bad luck.”

---

He gave her ten seconds or so to stare at the now-burning vehicle, then spoke again. “I do still need your help.”

Cassie tore her eyes away from the ever-growing flames thirty yards away. “Yes. Right. Okay. But, um. You seem okay. And you won’t let me call 911. Which I still don’t know why. So um. How would I be able to help you?” Maybe she should be more distrustful, but the burning car was so strange. And… had he known it would happen?

“Calling 911 is dangerous because they may send police. And a man with luck like mine doesn’t need any firearms around.”

She scrunched her brow in confusion. “They’re not gonna shoot you! There are only like 1,000 police shootings in the US a year, out of more than 300 million people, and considering that this is just a *car accident…”*

He frowned at her. “Okay, base rate girl. Again, very impressive. But that’s enough for now. We’re not taking the risk.”

“But…”

“Enough! I was right about the fire. So just accept that I might be right about this. Can you do that?”

The fire… was weird. Very weird. “The fire could have been - I don’t know - some flammable stuff in the car! Or maybe your gas tank had a leak?”

To her surprise, he smiled at her, and the smile was - she wasn’t sure, but it seemed - a little sad, and a little tired.

“The car was checked for problems just last night. And I was not traveling with any inflammatories. And we are not calling the police.”

She sighed. “Okay.” Fine. Maybe he had a point? A weird, ridiculous, impossible point, but… fine. She fiddled with her hair nervously, twirling a strand near her forehead around her finger. “What do you need?”

He put his hands in his coat pockets, turned, and looked down the long hill. “St. Aurelia‘s - I need to make it there.”

St. Aurelia’s. The hospital at the other end of town. Cassie had never had cause to visit in her year or so since moving here, but she’d been by it on her walks, and figured it was about two miles away. “Okay. Yeah, totally. Want me to call you a Lift?”

He chuckled harshly. “I’ve had enough of vehicles for the day. Walk with me there. I may need help on the way.”

“What kind of help?” It was a pretty straightforward walk - the sidewalk between this road and the treeline - the one she’d been taking - went straight through town, with St. Aurelia’s on the other side, just a block or two off this street once you got there.

“Please. Even a walk in my condition can have… unexpected pitfalls.”

She looked at him, confused. His condition? He had the small cut on the top of his head, in front of his hairline, and some sprinkles of glass still clung to his jacket sleeves, but he seemed perfectly fine. Maybe he meant his mental state - the crash must have affected him more than he was letting on. He had a commanding aura, and seemed like he had his head on straight, save for his weird ideas about his luck. But maybe putting on a brave front was a matter of habit for a guy like him. Poor guy. He’d had a hell of a day, and wasn’t she out here to walk, anyway?

“Okay!” She smiled at him. “I’ll walk you there. It’s not far - to get there, we just-“

“Walk about 1.8 miles on this road, through the middle of town, then take a right on Gravois, and go two more blocks.”

“Woah. You know numbers too, huh?”

He made a face. “I know them for St. Aurelia.”

Cassie thought of his missing fingers. Rough.

She started walking. “What’s your name?” she asked. Instead of falling in beside her, the man went past the treeline, and only when he was behind the first few rows of trees did he start going the right direction. They were grown pine trees, with big trunks. “My name is Davis.”

“Nice to meet you. Um, I guess. My name’s Cassie.” She eyes him as he navigates his way through the trees. “Why are you… walking over there?”

“If we’re too close, my bad luck could cause harm to you. For instance, if a car careened off the road as we were walking next to each other, or a tree fell on me.” He said this all so calm and straightforwardly that he could be one of her teachers describing a lesson plan. “Better that I be over here.”

“… Okay.” She’d probably argued enough about this already. She decided to let him have his paranoias. They walked for a while in silence in their odd parallel positions, her on the sidewalk next to the road and him in the woods.

“So… where were you headed before all this?” She had to raise her voice a little to make herself heard across the distance.

“St. Aurelia’s. Same place we’re headed now.”

“Oh! Is someone you know there?” She hoped not. His day already must have been terrible; having a friend or family member in the hospital too would be too much.

“No. I… had a feeling I’d need their services. I was getting as close as I could.

That was a very strange reason to go to the hospital, but, well, he hadn’t been wrong. She wasn’t one to argue with a guess that turned out to be right, no matter how strange it seemed a priori. Although her reason for that policy was that usually the guesser turned out to have some deep intuition about what was gonna happen, even though they couldn’t explain that intuition. What kind of intuition did Davis have for his car rolling over at 25 miles per hour?

“Are you a student?” His voice was gruff, and the question came off a little unnaturally. The voice of a guy who wasn’t used to small talk but was making an effort; she’d heard the same kind of voice coming from her dad when he made conversation with some of her friends back in high school.

“Yup! I’m a sophomore. Studying statistics.”

“Statistics, huh? Lots of good jobs there.”

She sighed. She wasn’t so sure. “Uh, yeah, that’s what people say. I just like how it feels to do it, you know?” But that didn’t mean the jobs would be interesting. “There’s, um, a career fair on Wednesday… maybe there’ll be some interesting ones there.”

“You don’t sound very excited.”

“Yeah, I don’t know… my dad is a stats guy, but when he talks about his work… he used to talk about, like, running t-tests all the time, but they all kinda seemed samey? Like running the same test every week and just… dutifully passing on the results. But at least he was doing stats, then, I guess. In the past couple years he’s switched to talking about databases and pipelines. I don’t really get it, but, um, I know that it sounds… boring.”

“Statistics can be critically useful. Especially in my line of work. It’s good you have an interest.”

She eyed him skeptically. He looked like an army guy from a movie, or a cop - not like a guy who dealt with numbers in depth. “So you… use statistics in your work?”

He smiled ruefully, still with his attention on picking his way through the trees, not looking at her. “You could say that. Or…” his smile went away. “… that statistics use me. My colleagues are the real pros. They say I should learn more about probability theory - that’s what they call it - but my time… ends up devoted to other things.”

They had made it to the end of the wooden area, and the town was ahead of them now. Cassie wasn’t surprised this time when Davis took the sidewalk across the road from her.

<introduce the town during their walk - businesses , parks, etc? Ehh maybe not>
